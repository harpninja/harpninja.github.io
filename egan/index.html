	<h3>Salvi Egan Harp for Sale</h3>
	<p>
	Beautiful Salvi Egan harp, mahogany colour, purchased in 2014. <br>
    <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KijW8uQ8d08'>Listen to a recording on youtube</a>
	</p>
	<p>
  The harp has all new strings and comes with:
    <ul>
      <li> A Salvi dust cover.
      <li> A heavy duty travel cover with base cover made by Salopian Strings in England (cost $550).
      <li> A set of all the non-wire strings, including some duplicates in octaves 2 and 3 (worth at least $450).
      <li> Bass wire string eyelets in the soundboard upgraded from brass to acrylic by Liza Jensen in March 2023.  
           I had this repair work done because some of the original eyelets on the strings had cracked. (cost $1000).
   </ul>
